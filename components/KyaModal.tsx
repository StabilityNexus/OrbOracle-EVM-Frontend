            This decentralized application is composed of smart contracts running on a blockchain
            and a website that eases your interaction with the smart contracts.
          </p>

          <p>
            The smart contracts and the website were developed by The Stable Order, an organization
            dedicated to making the world more stable.
          </p>

            . We strongly recommend that you do your own research and inspect the source code of
            any blockchain application that you wish to interact with. The source code is the only
            source of truth about the applications that you use.

                When you interact with any smart contract on any blockchain through any application,
                your transactions are recorded anonymously forever on the blockchain.

                  The smart contracts are executed autonomously by the blockchain's block validators.

                <li>
                  You may run the websites locally in your own computer. So, even if, for any
                  reason, the websites deployed in our own domains become unavailable, you can still
                  interact with the smart contracts.

          <p>
            Interacting with blockchain applications may involve risks such as the following
            (non-exhaustively):
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>
              You may lose your wallet password, recovery phrases or private keys, thereby losing
              access to your assets.
            </li>
            <li>
              Hackers may succeed in obtaining your wallet password, recovery phrases or private
              keys, thereby gaining access to your assets.
            </li>
            <li>
              The blockchain may become congested or unavailable, resulting in delays in the
              confirmation of your transactions.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you are interacting with a centralized blockchain (a.k.a. "L2", "sidechain",
              "Proof-of-Authority blockchain", ...), the block validators may decide to stop
              operating the blockchain.
            </li>
            <li>
              The external infrastructure on which a decentralized application depends may
              experience issues or become unavailable.
              <ul className="list-circle pl-6 mt-1">
                <li>Oracles, in particular, may suffer delays or manipulations.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              The source code of the smart contracts and the website may contain bugs that may cause
              the application to behave unexpectedly and unfavourably.
            </li>
            <li>
              The algorithms and protocols implemented by the code may have unforeseen behaviors.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            While we do our best to ensure that we implement good algorithms and protocols, that the
            implementations are free from bugs, and that the deployed applications are fully or
            minimally dependent on external infrastructure, you use the applications at your own
            risk. You are solely responsible for your assets. You are solely responsible for the
            security of your wallet (and its password, recovery phrase and private keys). The Stable
            Order does not operate any blockchain, server or external infrastructure on which the
            application depends, and hence The Stable Order is not responsible for their operation.
          </p>

          <p>
            We will never ask for your password, recovery phrase or private keys. Anyone asking this
            information from you is almost certainly a scammer.

            We do not provide support of any kind. We do research and development. Uses of the
